## About The Project

[![Game ScreenShot][game-screenshot]](https://github.com/filliperomero/InterfaceHero)

This project was developed through a comprehensive course focused on building a **fully modular, AAA-quality UI system** using Unreal Engine 5’s **Common UI framework** and C++. It was structured with scalability, gamepad support, and real-world usability in mind.

We started by laying the UI foundation with a primary layout, gameplay-tagged widget stacks, and async widget loading. From there, we added a **"Press Any Key" screen**, a dynamic **main menu**, and a responsive **options screen** with multiple categories (audio, graphics, gameplay, input).

A **custom Game User Settings** system was created to persist player preferences, alongside a full **input remapping feature** using preprocessors. Finally, the project was wrapped with **startup and in-game loading screens** for a polished experience.

All systems are fully data-driven using Unreal's **Data Registry** system and designed with **modularity and reuse** in mind — perfect for Blueprint/C++ hybrid projects.
